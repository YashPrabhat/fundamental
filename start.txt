hey , i am yash ,and i am just 
curious why i am witnessing a .swp file extension 
when i am creating a text file through vim

Each commit has a hash ID. So, each commit is built on top of each other.
So, if jyou wanted to delete any commit from the middle, you will not be able toremove only that commit from the middle. 

INSTEAD you will have to remove all the commits above it.


COMMAND 

git reset <hash value>

use hash value of that commit above which are those commits which are to be
removed.
